# ðŸ“Š Table Page ðŸ“Š

This application is a dynamic web platform designed for efficient data management. Leveraging the power of modern web technologies, we've developed a robust and responsive solution for tabulated data operations.

## Features

- **Data Display**: Intuitively presents records in a structured tabular format.
- **Search by ID**: Provides an efficient search mechanism to quickly locate specific data entries using their ID.
- **Data Operations**: Seamlessly perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Technologies Used

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: A React framework for production-grade applications with server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)**: Used for efficient state management and asynchronous logic.
- **[Formik](https://formik.org/)**: For building scalable, performant forms with ease in React.
- **[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)**: Preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
- **[Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)**: Used for object schema validation.
- **[React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)**: Popular icons in your React projects.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
